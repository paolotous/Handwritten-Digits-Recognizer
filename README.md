# Handwritten-Digits-Recognizer
Python application that uses KNN to predict the handwritten digit drawn by the user.

Tools Used:

Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Tkinter, OpenCV, Numpy, Joblib

Classifier: KNN

Summary: The model is trained first with existing Sklearn digit recognition dataset, afterwards we load that model in our GUI application.

User would draw a digit on the canvas. User can save the image ( Can be helpful to create a brand new dataset ).

User can use the trained Classifier to predict the handwritten digit.
